# Code repository for the paper <TBD>

This repository contains the code for the paper <TBD> by <TBD>.

This repository helps you to make predictions of oceanic surface density $\sigma_T$ using your own data. You can find an example of how to use the code in [this notebook](https://github.com/nicrie/density_uncertainty/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb)


## Installation

The code is written in Python 3. 
Installing the necessary dependencies to make predictions is easiest with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).


```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sigmaT
```

## Usage

Check out the [example notebook](https://github.com/nicrie/density_uncertainty/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb) to see how to use the code to make predictions of $\sigma_T$.
